      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to my website! I am a current first-year Ph.D. student and research assistant in political science at the
        <strong>University of Georgia</strong>. I earned both my M.A. and Bachelor’s degrees from the
        <strong>University of Mississippi</strong> in 2021 and 2023, and plan to graduate from UGA in the class of 2030.
      </p>
      <p>
        My academic journey has helped me develop a strong background in political behavior and public opinion,
        with a particular focus on how institutional contexts shape the attitudes and actions of citizens. I am
        passionate about teaching and research, and I enjoy working collaboratively with students and colleagues on
        projects that seek to understand contemporary political phenomena.

      <h2>Research Interests</h2>
      <p>
        My research centers on political behavior within the American electorate. I am especially interested in how
        historical and institutional developments influence modern attitudes and partisan attachments. Topics that
        currently motivate my work include American political development (APD), polarization, and partisanship.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through quantitative and qualitative methods, I aim to investigate the historical roots of modern
        partisan divides, the role of political institutions in shaping ideological landscapes, and the ways in which
        social identities intersect with politics. In doing so, I strive to produce scholarly work that not only advances academic
        understanding but also informs public discourse.
